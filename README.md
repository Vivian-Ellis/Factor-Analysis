# Factor-Analysis
The HBAT 200 database will be used to preform factor analysis and determine which of the 13 performance variables could be reduced and grouped. This database is like HBAT however, there is 200 records instead of 100. Firstly, the correlation matrix shows that ecommerce is significantly correlated to complaint, advertising, sales image, ordering, price flex, and delivery speed with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.19176, 0.50520, 0.78822, 0.21689, 0.18624, and 0.24081 respectively. Production quality is significantly correlated to product line, pricing, and price flex with a p-value <.01 and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.50930, -0.44811, and -0.48721 respectively. Tech support and warranty are highly positively correlated at 0.83782 with ap-value <.01, this would lead me to believe that HBAT provides excellent tech support for those customers with warranties. In addition, since complain and advertising are significantly correlated to each other and ecommerce, they share the same significantly correlated variables as ecommerce; sales image, ordering, price flex, and delivery speed.
